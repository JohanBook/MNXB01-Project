###### 2017-10-27
The project plan has been discussed and updated. The workload has been distributed between the three of us.
/Edvin Jakobsson


###### 2017-10-29
A basic template for the project have been setup together with sketches for basic IO.
/Johan Book


###### 2017-10-31
The classes tpoint and treader have been developped to facilitate IO. treader reads data line for line and returns a tpoint for each line, which contains all data.
/Johan Book


###### 2017-10-32
Customized tpoint and treader to be able to determine format (SMHI or Uppsala) and parse it on its own.
/Johan Book


###### 2017-11-06
The file global_warming.C has been created which contains a function for creating a histogram that shows the average temperature over the years 1722-2013.
/Edvin Jakobsson


###### 2017-11-02
Created branch transparent_graphs where cool_image.C is producing several different graphs which will later will be combined to a single image.
/Johan Book


###### 2017-11-05
Saratrial.cpp added in order to read the data of the file Uppsala.dat into a bidimensional array and then store in two different arrays the number of each year and the highest temperature of each year.
/Sara Gabrielli


###### 2017-11-06
Sara_Producefiles.C is complete, it also stores in an array the hottest and the coldest days and produces two output files to be analyzed by Sara_Analyze.C.
/Sara Gabrielli


###### 2017-11-07
Sara_Analyze.C is nearly complete: it reads the files produced from Sara_Producefiles.C and ignores the data which were not recorded in Uppsala, then it analyzes data. It works, but the functions fitting the histogram for the coldest day are not working.
/Sara Gabrielli


###### 2017-11-07
global_warming.C is almost complete. It works fine and creates the histogram expected. What is left is tidying up the code to make it simpler. Comments are also needed.
/Edvin Jakobsson


###### 2017-11-07
The report has been discussed between the three of us and the workload has been distributed. Another meeting has been set in order to together create slides for the presentation.
/Edvin Jakobsson


###### 2017-11-08
global_warming.C is complete. It works as expected and the code is now written in a more constistant way and with many comments explaining it.
/Edvin Jakobsson


###### 2017-11-08
Sara_Analyze.C is complete and works as espected producing both the histograms of hottest and coldest days and tridimensional graphs.
/Sara Gabrielli


##### 2017-11-09
Report-part complete. Introduction also added.
